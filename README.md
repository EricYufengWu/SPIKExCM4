### Raspberry Pi CM4 Carrier Board for LEGO SPIKE Prime

This is the final project for my Microcontrollers Programming Class. My professor gave us an open prompt which is "create something that is useful". With my previous experience and interests in designing LEGO Robotics expansion hardware, I developed a Raspberry Pi CM4 Carrier board specifically for the LEGO SPIKE Prime educational system. In short, this is a slim, self-contained add-on to the SPIKE Prime hub. It gives the educational platform a huge boost in computational power and peripheral connectivity, making it capable of running tasks such as image processing, machine learning, ROS, and more.
